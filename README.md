<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
[![YouTube Video Demo](Readme_Images/YouTube_Video_Img.png)](https://youtu.be/8cnLMpcupUE)

SafeWayz is a mobile application that helps users find the safest route throughout the city of San Francisco!

An Android mobile application as well as eclipse-terminal version are available for use.

The application was developed using the concepts of Data Structures & Algorithms and software development principles.

## Built With
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Java](https://java.com/en/download/)
* [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/)
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation)
* [GSON API](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/module-summary.html)

Python and Pandas were used to perform Data Cleaning and Data Formatting. 

Java was used to build the android application as well as the algorithms being used: 
* Depth First Search (DFS)
* Breath First Search(BFS)
* Dijkstra's least crime algorithm
* QuickSort
* Binary Search

The Google Maps API was used to bring in core functionality into the mobile application. Finally, the GSON API was used to convert JSON files into Hashtables/ Dictionary Objects
